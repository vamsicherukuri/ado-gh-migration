# ADO2GH Step 0: Generate Inventory Report
#
# Description:
#   This script generates an inventory report of Azure DevOps repositories at the
#   organization level using the gh ado2gh CLI extension. This report is used to
#   identify repositories for migration planning.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - ADO_PAT environment variable set with full access scope
#   - migration-config.json exists with proper configuration
#
# Order of operations:
# [1/3] Validate ADO PAT tokens
# [2/3] Load configuration from migration-config.json
#       - Reads adoOrganization from config.scripts.inventory.adoOrg
# [3/3] Generate inventory report using gh ado2gh inventory-report
#       - Creates CSV files in current directory
#
# Usage:
#   .\0_Inventory.ps1
#   .\0_Inventory.ps1 -ConfigPath "custom-config.json"
#
# Output Files:
#   - orgs.csv (list of ADO organizations)
#   - team-projects.csv (list of team projects)
#   - repos.csv (list of repositories - used by subsequent scripts)
#   - pipelines.csv (list of pipelines)
